This is a game made with Python and Pygame.
The player controls the left paddle, while the right paddle is controlled by a basic rule-based AI.


 How to Play

 Use W and S keys to move your paddle up and down.
 The goal is to bounce the ball and score points by making the AI miss.

 AI Description

The AI is rule-based:
- It tracks the ball position when the ball moves toward it.
- It adjusts its paddle position based on the ball’s direction and distance.
- Random “error margins” are used to make the AI less perfect, depending on difficulty level.

 Difficulty  Speed  Reaction Distance    Error Margin
 Easy     -   6    -     400        -        30
 Medium   -   8    -     600        -        15
 Hard     -   10   -     800        -        5
